\# Weather App ðŸŒ¤



This is a visually dynamic weather app that I personally built during my \*\*first year of college in 2020\*\*, while I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

It was one of my first hands-on projects, developed to explore \*\*front-end web development\*\* and API integration.
